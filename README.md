With this Audio Player sample app you can play audio with Apache Cordova Media API,
a third-party Cordova Low-Latency Audio Plugin, and the W3C standard HTML5 Audio tag.

The Audio Player App demonstrates how to play local audio files and stream online
audio files using the Cordova* media plugin. It also demonstrates use of a third-party
[Cordova native audio plugin](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-plugin-nativeaudio)
that can play two audio files concurrently. For more details regarding the sample
