## Project Details ##

This sample is part of the Intel® XDK. 
Download the Intel® XDK at [http://software.intel.com/en-us/html5](http://software.intel.com/en-us/html5). With the Audio Player sample you can play audio with Apache Cordova Media API, Cordova Low Latency Audio Plugin for iOS and Android and the HTML5 Audio tag.


The Audio Player App demonstrates how to play local and stream online audio files using the Cordova* media plugin. It also demonstrates use of the [Cordova Native Audio Plugin](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-plugin-nativeaudio) to demonstrates playing two music files concurrently. To see the technical details of the sample, 
please visit the **[included tutorial][]**.

## NOTE: ##

Please ignore the `config.xml` file, the Cordova CLI `config.xml` format has
been changing significantly, especially with the release of CLI 5.0, and this
`config.xml` file has not been updated to reflect those changes. It will not
work as written. It was originally created for use with PhoneGap CLI and has
not been updated for use with the current PhoneGap CLI system, either.
